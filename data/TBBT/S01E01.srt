00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,840
{\fs16\an2\b0}如果一个光子打向有两个狭缝的平面
So if a photon is directed through a plane

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,530
{\fs16\an2\b0}如果有一个狭缝可以观测到
with two slits in it and either slit is observed,

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,530
{\fs16\an2\b0}那它没有同时通过两个狭缝
it will not go through both slits.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,830
{\fs16\an2\b0}如果观测不到  那它会通过
If it's unobserved,it will.

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,390
{\fs16\an2\b0}但如果它是在离开平面后
However,if it's observed after it's left the plane

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,680
{\fs16\an2\b0}在击中目标物之前被观测到
But before it hits its target,

7
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,060
{\fs16\an2\b0}那它不会同时通过两个狭缝
it won't have gone through both slits.

8
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,240
{\fs16\an2\b0}没错  你想说什么
Agreed. what's your point?

9
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,620
{\fs16\an2\b0}没什么  我只是觉得这个主意放在T恤上不错
There's no point,I just think it's a good idea for a t-shirt.

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,720
{\fs16\an2\b0}-您好  -稍等
-excuse me. -hang on.

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,720
{\fs16\an2\b0}横1是"爱琴海"
One across is "aegean."

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,230
{\fs16\an2\b0}竖8是"纳巴科夫"(1899-1977  俄裔美国小说家)
Eight down is "nabokov."

14
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,710
{\fs16\an2\b0}横26"MCM"
26 across is "mcm."

15
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,280
{\fs16\an2\b0}竖14是...你手挡住了...
14 down is... move your finger...

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,790
{\fs16\an2\b0}是"门"(生物分类)  所以说横十四是"太子港"(海地首都)
"phylum" which makes 14 across "port-au-prince"

17
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,650
{\fs16\an2\b0}你看  "Papa Doc"(海地总统绰号)提示了  所以是"太子港"
See,"papa doc's capitol idea," that's "port-au-prince."

18
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,150
{\fs16\an2\b0}在海地

Is this the high-iq sperm bank?

21
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,660
{\fs16\an2\b0}如果这还要问的话  那你可能不该来这
If you have to ask,maybe you shouldn't be here.

22
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,410
{\fs16\an2\b0}我看就是这儿了
I think this is the place.

23
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,340
{\fs16\an2\b0}-把表格填了  -谢谢

00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,400
{\fs16\an2\b0}-马上就好  -不急
-we'll be right back. -take your time.

25
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,750
{\fs16\an2\b0}我正好把填字游戏做完
I'll just finish my crossword puzzle.

26
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,330

{\fs16\an2\b0}莱纳德  我觉得我做不到
Leonard,I don't think I can do this.

28
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,070
{\fs16\an2\b0}开什么玩笑  你都是"半职业选手"了
What,are you kidding? you're a semi-pro.

29
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,580
{\fs16\an2\b0}不是的  我们这是在犯基因欺诈罪
No. we are committing genetic fraud.

30
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,460
{\fs16\an2\b0}我们的精子并不能保证
There's no guarantee that our sperm

31
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,170
{\fs16\an2\b0}将来就能生出高智商的后代
is going to generate high-iqOffspring.

32
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,940
{\fs16\an2\b0}你想想  我姐姐和我的DNA结构相同
Think about that. I have a sister with the same basic dna mix

33
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,720
{\fs16\an2\b0}可她只是快餐店的女服务生
Who hostesses at fuddruckers.

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,800
{\fs16\an2\b0}谢尔顿  当初是你要来的
Sheldon,this was your idea.

35
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,170
{\fs16\an2\b0}这点补贴能让我们

36
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,560
{\fs16\an2\b0}在寓所里拥有分式T-1带宽
fractional t-1 bandwidth in the apartment.

37
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,320
{\fs16\an2\b0}我知道  我的确渴望更快的下载速度
I know,and I do yearn for faster downloads.

38
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,450
{\fs16\an2\b0}但那些可怜的女人们
But there's some poor woman

39
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,630
{\fs16\an2\b0}会把希望寄托在我精子上的
who's gonna pin her hopes on my sperm.

40
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,280
{\fs16\an2\b0}如果她最后发现那小不点连曲线下面积
What if she winds up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should use

41
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,850
{\fs16\an2\b0}该用积分还是微分算都不知道  她会怎么想
An integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve?

42
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,340
{\fs16\an2\b0}-我肯定她还是会爱他的  -我不会
-i'm sure she'll still love him. -i wouldn't.

43
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,010
{\fs16\an2\b0}你现在想怎么样
Well,what do you want to do?

44
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,130
{\fs16\an2\b0}我想走了
I want to leave.

45
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,270
{\fs16\an2\b0}该怎么跟她说呢
What's the protocol for leaving?

46
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,860
{\fs16\an2\b0}我不知道...我以前从来没在捐献精子时中途走人过
I don't know... I've never reneged on a proffer of sperm before.

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,850
{\fs16\an2\b0}我们就直接走吧
Let's try just walking out.

48
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,230
{\fs16\an2\b0}-再见  -再见  很高兴见到你
-bye. -bye. nice meeting you.

49
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,930
{\fs16\an2\b0}你还在为那个精子库的事生气吗
Are you still mad about the sperm bank?

50
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,560
{\fs16\an2\b0}没有
No.

00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,230
{\fs16\an2\b0}你想不想听有关楼梯的有趣事情
You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?

52
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,750
{\fs16\an2\b0}不太想
Not really.

53
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,330
{\fs16\an2\b0}如果有一格阶梯的高度存在哪怕两毫米的微小差距
If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimeters,

54
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,790
{\fs16\an2\b0}-大多数人会被绊倒  -跟我无关
-most people will trip. -i don't care.

55
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,470
{\fs16\an2\b0}两毫...那不太可能吧
Two milli... that doesn't seem right.

56

{\fs16\an2\b0}不  是真的  我12岁时做过一系列试验
No,it's true,I did a series of experiments when I was 12

{\fs16\an2\b0}我爸爸还摔断了锁骨
My father broke his clavicle.

58
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,930
{\fs16\an2\b0}你就是因为这个被他们送去寄宿学校的?
Is that why they sent you to boarding school?

59
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,730
{\fs16\an2\b0}不是  是因为我那些关于激光的试验
No. that was a result of my work with lasers.

60
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,770
{\fs16\an2\b0}这是新邻居?
New neighbor?

61
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,990
{\fs16\an2\b0}很明显

{\fs16\an2\b0}比起上一个的水准真是有显著提高

{\fs16\an2\b0}我们不是住在一起  我是说...
We don't live together. I mean...

{\fs16\an2\b0}我们是住在一起

{\fs16\an2\b0}欢迎成为我们的邻居

Should we have invited her for lunch?

No.We're gonna start season two of battlestar galactica.

We already watched the season two dvds.

82
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,500
{\fs16\an2\b0}但评论音轨还没看

83
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,130
{\fs16\an2\b0}我觉得我们应该做个好邻居
I think we should be good neighbors

86
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,170
{\fs16\an2\b0}那是我们的不对
And that was wrong of us.

87
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,740
{\fs16\an2\b0}我们得扩大下我们的朋友圈子

{\fs16\an2\b0}我的朋友圈子已经很大了

Yes,and you've never met one of them.

{\fs16\an2\b0}这正是其美妙之处

92
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,450
{\fs16\an2\b0}我要请她过来
I'm gonna invite her over.

{\fs16\an2\b0}我们可以好好吃一顿  然后...聊天
We'll have a nice meal and... chat.

94
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,480
{\fs16\an2\b0}聊天?  我们平时不聊天  至少下了网不聊
Chat? we don't chat. at least not offline.

95
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,190
{\fs16\an2\b0}这没什么难的
It's not difficult.

96
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,830
{\fs16\an2\b0}你只要听着她讲些什么

97
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,770
{\fs16\an2\b0}然后你适当地回应她一些

98
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,170
{\fs16\an2\b0}那最后要干什么?

99
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,750
{\fs16\an2\b0}你好...又来了

100
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,750
{\fs16\an2\b0}你好
Hi.

101
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,050
{\fs16\an2\b0}那个...

102
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,150
{\fs16\an2\b0}我们带了印度菜回来
We brought home indian food.

103
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,170
{\fs16\an2\b0}然后...
And...

104
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,860
{\fs16\an2\b0}我知道搬家可能会很累
I know that moving can be stressful,

105
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,160
{\fs16\an2\b0}并且我发现当我身心俱疲时
And I find that when I'm undergoing stress,

106
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,440
{\fs16\an2\b0}美食和伙伴能让我感觉很舒坦
That good food and company can have a comforting effect.

107
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,810
{\fs16\an2\b0}还有  咖喱本身有通便功效  我想我不必再说
Also,curry is a natural laxative,and I don't have to tell you

108
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,560
{\fs16\an2\b0}你知道  如果大肠通畅...
That,you know,a clean colon is just...

109
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,670
{\fs16\an2\b0}那又可以少一件操心事了
One less thing to worry about.

110
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,280
{\fs16\an2\b0}这方面我不在行  不过我相信如果是邀请别人吃午餐
I'm no expert,but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation,

111
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,860
{\fs16\an2\b0}你最好不要说些肠运动的事
You might want to skip the reference to bowel movements.

112
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,230
{\fs16\an2\b0}你们是在邀请我过去吃饭?
You're inviting me over to eat?

113
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,810
{\fs16\an2\b0}是的

116
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,280
{\fs16\an2\b0}你们平时都玩些什么
So,what do you guys do for fun around here?

117
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,700
{\fs16\an2\b0}今天我们尝试过靠自慰来挣钱
Today we tried masturbating for money.

118

{\fs16\an2\b0}-莱纳德  这是你写的?  -不  这是我的
-leonard,did you do this? -actually,that's my work.

124
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,330
{\fs16\an2\b0}不错  只是一些量子力学而已
Yeah. well,it's just some quantum mechanics

125
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,670
{\fs16\an2\b0}边上还随便写了一点点弦理论
With a little string theory doodling around the edges.

126
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,290
{\fs16\an2\b0}那部分  是我开的玩笑
That part there,that's just a joke.

127
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,280
{\fs16\an2\b0}讽刺下波恩-奥本海默近似
It's a spoof of the born-oppenheimer approximation.

128
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,020
{\fs16\an2\b0}这么说  你就像是"美丽心灵"里那种天才一样
So you're like one of those beautiful mind genius guys.

129
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:57,810
{\fs16\an2\b0}是吧
Yeah.

130
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,040
{\fs16\an2\b0}-真让人赞叹  -我也有块板
-this is really impressive. -i have a board.

131
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,240
{\fs16\an2\b0}如果你喜欢板  这块是我的
If you like boards,this is my board.

132
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,590
{\fs16\an2\b0}上帝啊
Holy smokes.

133
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,170
{\fs16\an2\b0}如果你说"上帝啊"是想
If by "holy smokes",you mean

134
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,160
{\fs16\an2\b0}再一次强调说你能在任何一个麻省理工的
A derivative restatement of the kind of stuff

135
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,340
{\fs16\an2\b0}男生寝室墙上发现那些涂鸦  那一点没错
You can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at mit,sure.

136
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,560
{\fs16\an2\b0}-什么?  -得了吧
-what? -come on.

137
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,290
{\fs16\an2\b0}谁没看到那微分上面写着"我打住了  心碎了  算不下去了"
Who hasn't seen this differential below "here I sit,broken-hearted"?

138
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,210
{\fs16\an2\b0}至少我不会为了解决个数学问题
At least I didn't have to invent 26 dimensions

139
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,600
{\fs16\an2\b0}去发明个什么26维出来
Just to make the math come out.

140
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,180
{\fs16\an2\b0}我没有创造发明  他们本来就有
I didn't invent them. they're there.

141
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,420
{\fs16\an2\b0}-哪个宇宙有?  -所有的都有...这就是我说的关键
-in what universe? -in all of them... that is the point.

142
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,860
{\fs16\an2\b0}你们介意我先开吃吗
Do you guys mind if I start?

143
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,460
{\fs16\an2\b0}佩妮...
Penny...

144
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,590
{\fs16\an2\b0}这是我的座位
That's where l sit.

145
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,760
{\fs16\an2\b0}那  你坐我旁边

{\fs16\an2\b0}不...我坐那里的
No... I sit there.

147
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,660
{\fs16\an2\b0}有什么区别
What's the difference?

148
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,860
{\fs16\an2\b0}-什么区别?  -开始了
-what's the difference? -here we go.

149
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,970
{\fs16\an2\b0}在冬天  这个位子离暖气比较近所以比较暖和
In the winter,that seat is close enough to the radiator

150
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,940
{\fs16\an2\b0}但也不至于太近以至于引起出汗
To remain warm,and yet not so close as to cause perspiration

151
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,450
{\fs16\an2\b0}在夏天  通过窗子吹进来的风直接在这里交叉
In the summer,it's directly in the path of a cross-breeze

152
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,520
{\fs16\an2\b0}就是这边和那边的窗户
Created by opening windows there and there.

153
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,260
{\fs16\an2\b0}看电视正好有个角度
It faces the television at an angle

154
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,820
{\fs16\an2\b0}不会太正  从而影响跟别人说话
That is neither direct,thus discouraging conversation,

155
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,390
{\fs16\an2\b0}也不会太斜  从而造成脖子酸疼
Nor so far wide as to create a parallax distortion.

156
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,720
{\fs16\an2\b0}我还能继续  不过我觉得你已经明白我的意思了
I could go on,but I think I've made my point.

157
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,280
{\fs16\an2\b0}你想让我移开吗
Do you want me to move?

158
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,310
{\fs16\an2\b0}你就随便坐一下吧
-well... -just sit somewhere else.

159
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,590
{\fs16\an2\b0}好的
Fine.

160
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:35,880
{\fs16\an2\b0}谢尔顿  坐下!
Sheldon,sit!

161
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,830
{\fs16\an2\b0}这样很好啊
Well,this is nice.

162
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,630
{\fs16\an2\b0}不太有人来我们这里作客的
We don't have a lot of company over.

163
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,470
{\fs16\an2\b0}不是吧  库萨帕里和沃尔维茨就经常过来
That's not true. koothrappali and wolowitz come over all the time.

164
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,980
{\fs16\an2\b0}-是  我知道  但...  -星期二晚上
-yes i know,but... -tuesday night,

165
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,940
{\fs16\an2\b0}我们还玩"克林贡拼字游戏"玩到凌晨一点(克林贡是外星人)
We played klingon boggle till 1:00 a.m.

166
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,970
{\fs16\an2\b0}是  我记得
Yeah,I remember.

167
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,930
{\fs16\an2\b0}-不要说我们没有伙伴  -对不起
-don't say we don't have company. -sorry.

168
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,960
{\fs16\an2\b0}-这是社交上很消极的暗示  -我说对不起了
-that has negative social implications. -i said I'm sorry!

169
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,870
{\fs16\an2\b0}"克林贡拼字游戏"?
Klingon boggle?

170
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,320
{\fs16\an2\b0}是的  就是普通的拼字游戏  只不过...
Yeah. it's like regular boggle,but...

171
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,600
{\fs16\an2\b0}是用克林贡语言
In klingon.

172
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,920
{\fs16\an2\b0}关于我们已经说得够多了  说说你吧
That's probably enough about us. so,tell us about you.

173
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,040
{\fs16\an2\b0}我?  好吧
Me? okay.

174
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,870
{\fs16\an2\b0}我是射手座的
I'm a sagittarius,

175
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,310
{\fs16\an2\b0}就这一点你们很可能就了解得比我想说的多得多了
Which probably tells you way more than you need to know.

176
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,600
{\fs16\an2\b0}没错  我们可以了解到你有群众性文化妄想
Yes. it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion

177
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,010
{\fs16\an2\b0}就是指你出生时
That the sun's apparent position

178
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,070
{\fs16\an2\b0}相对于任意确定星座的太阳的视位置
Relative to arbitrarily defined constellations at the time of your birth

179
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,010
{\fs16\an2\b0}可能会决定你的性格
Somehow affects your personality.

180
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,110
{\fs16\an2\b0}有什么来着?
Participate in the what?

181
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,500
{\fs16\an2\b0}我认为谢尔顿是想说
I think what sheldon's trying to say

182
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,520
{\fs16\an2\b0}我们可能不会第一个猜你是"射手座"的
Is that sagittarius wouldn't have been our first guess.

183
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,170
{\fs16\an2\b0}是  很多人会以为我是水相星座的
Yeah,a lot of people think I'm a water sign.

And the occasional steak. I love steak!

187
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,810
{\fs16\an2\b0}真有趣
Well,that's interesting.

{\fs16\an2\b0}我是不吃...我只是觉得那东西不错
I don't eat it... I just think it's a good idea.

Anyways,I'm also writing a screenplay.

195

{\fs16\an2\b0}讲一个多愁善感的女生从内布拉斯加州的林肯来到了洛杉矶
It's about this sensitive girl who comes to l.a. from lincoln,nebraska,

196

{\fs16\an2\b0}她本想当名演员  最终却在乳酪蛋糕店当了服务生
To be an actress and winds up a waitress at the cheesecake factory.

197
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,960
{\fs16\an2\b0}看来这是根据你的经历写的
So,it's based on your life.

198

{\fs16\an2\b0}不  我是来自奥马哈

{\fs16\an2\b0}大概就这些了
Guess that's about it.

203
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,090
{\fs16\an2\b0}这就是佩妮的故事了
That's the story of penny.

204
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,780
{\fs16\an2\b0}真不错
It sounds wonderful.

205
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,150
{\fs16\an2\b0}是不错

4 years... that's like as long as high school.

00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,580
{\fs16\an2\b0}你花了4年才读完高中?
It took you 4 years to get through high school?

211
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,070
{\fs16\an2\b0}真...不敢相信我竟然那么信任他
It just... I can't believe I trusted him.

212
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,630
{\fs16\an2\b0}我该说些什么吗?  我感觉我该说些什么
Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.

213
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,450
{\fs16\an2\b0}你?  算了  你只会越帮越忙
You? no,you'll only make it worse.

214

{\fs16\an2\b0}你们想知道最悲哀的是什么吗
You want to know the most pathetic part?

{\fs16\an2\b0}即使我已经恨透了他的谎言  他的不忠

216
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,150
{\fs16\an2\b0}我还是爱他
I still love him.

217
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,170
{\fs16\an2\b0}我是不是疯了?
Is that crazy?

218
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:25,970
{\fs16\an2\b0}是疯了
Yes.

219
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,150
{\fs16\an2\b0}不  不是的  这只是...
No,it's not crazy. it's a...

220
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,600
{\fs16\an2\b0}只是一种悖论
It's a paradox.

221
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:37,350
{\fs16\an2\b0}自然界中到处都存在着悖论  比如说光
Paradoxes are part of nature. think about light.

222
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,950
{\fs16\an2\b0}按照惠更斯的理论  光是一种波
If you look at huygens,light is a wave,

223
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,910
{\fs16\an2\b0}双缝实验证明了这一观点
As confirmed by the double-slit experiments,

224
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,330
{\fs16\an2\b0}不过后来有了爱因斯坦
But then along comes albert einstein

225
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,700
{\fs16\an2\b0}他发现光原来也具有粒子性
And discovers that light behaves like particles,too.

226
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,950
{\fs16\an2\b0}我至少没越帮倒忙
Well,I didn't make it worse.

227
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,370
{\fs16\an2\b0}我真的很抱歉  我真是一团糟
I'm so sorry. I'm such a mess.

228
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,930
{\fs16\an2\b0}最糟的是  我搬家都搬得恶心死了
On top of everything else,I'm all gross from moving

229
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,640
{\fs16\an2\b0}没想到该死的淋浴器还不能用了
And my stupid shower doesn't even work.

230
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,820
{\fs16\an2\b0}我们的可以用啊
Our shower works.

231
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,620
{\fs16\an2\b0}真的?  如果我在这里洗你们会不会介意?
Really? would it be totally weird if I used it?

232
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,970
{\fs16\an2\b0}-会  -不会
-yes. -no.

233
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,090
{\fs16\an2\b0}-不会  -不会
-no. -no.

234
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,310
{\fs16\an2\b0}就在那边
It's right down the hall.

235
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,590
{\fs16\an2\b0}谢谢
Thanks.

236
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,290
{\fs16\an2\b0}你们真是太好了

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,450
{\fs16\an2\b0}这番进步有意思啊
Well,this is an interesting development.

238
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,490
{\fs16\an2\b0}怎么?
How so?

239
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,800
{\fs16\an2\b0}上次有个女人在我们这里轻解罗裳
It has been some time since we've had a woman

240
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,600
{\fs16\an2\b0}距离现在已经很久了
Take her clothes off in our apartment.

241
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,220
{\fs16\an2\b0}不见得啊  记得感恩节
That's not true. remember at thanksgiving,

242
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,780
{\fs16\an2\b0}我那老年痴呆的祖母上演的那段?
My grandmother with alzheimer's had that episode?

243
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,590
{\fs16\an2\b0}明白了  距离上次有女人
Point taken. it has been some time

244
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,550
{\fs16\an2\b0}在我们这里轻解罗裳  并且看了之后
Since we've had a woman take her clothes off,

245
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,000
{\fs16\an2\b0}我们不想把眼睛给挖出来的  已经很久了
After which we didn't want to rip our eyes out.

246
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,290
{\fs16\an2\b0}其实最糟的是看她切那火鸡
The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.

247
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,190
{\fs16\an2\b0}你现在究竟是要干些什么呢
So what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?

248
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,190
{\fs16\an2\b0}你说什么?
Excuse me?

249
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,500
{\fs16\an2\b0}那女人不会跟你上床的
That woman is not going to have sex with you.

250
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,990
{\fs16\an2\b0}我没有想要跟她上床
I'm not trying to have sex with her.

251
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,120
{\fs16\an2\b0}那就好  这样你就不会失望了
Good. then you won't be disappointed.

252
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,710
{\fs16\an2\b0}你凭什么认为她不会和我上床了
What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me?

253
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,750
{\fs16\an2\b0}我是男的  她是女的
I'm a male and she's a female.

254
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,390
{\fs16\an2\b0}没错  但不是同一物种

00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,730
{\fs16\an2\b0}我才不跟你讨论什么假设
I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals here.

258
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,670
{\fs16\an2\b0}那也不是说如果有机会可以发展肉体关系
That's not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop,

259
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,340
{\fs16\an2\b0}我会袖手旁观
That I wouldn't participate.

260
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,820
{\fs16\an2\b0}大致是这样
However briefly.

261
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,710
{\fs16\an2\b0}当她发现你的卢克·天行者(星球大战人物)无泪洗发水
Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered

262
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,260
{\fs16\an2\b0}你说这种可能性是会变大了呢还是变小了
When she discovers your luke skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?

263
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,250
{\fs16\an2\b0}那是达斯·维德(另一星战人物)牌洗发水
It's darth vader shampoo.

-wait till you see this. -it's fantastic,unbelievable.

{\fs16\an2\b0}看什么?
See what?

{\fs16\an2\b0}现在不是时候
This isn't a good time.

It's before he became a creepy computer voice.

-that's great. you guys have to go. -why?

271
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,650
{\fs16\an2\b0}现在不是时候
It's just not a good time.

272
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,360
{\fs16\an2\b0}莱纳德有女士来访
Leonard has a lady over.

Yeah,right... your grandmother back in town?

274
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,270
{\fs16\an2\b0}不是  她不是什么女士  她是新来的邻居
No. And she's not a lady. she's just a new neighbor.

275
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,960
{\fs16\an2\b0}等等  这里真的有位女士?
Hang on,there really is a lady here?

{\fs16\an2\b0}我没有想要和她交媾
I'm not anticipating coitus.

00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,740

So she's available for coitus?

279
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,240
{\fs16\an2\b0}我们可不可以不要说"交媾"这个词了
Can we please just stop saying "coitus"?

280
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,140
{\fs16\an2\b0}更精确的说法应该是"体外射精"
Technically,that would be"coitus interruptus. "

It's french for "good shower. "

It's a sentiment I can express in six languages.

That's a biological impossibility. and you didn't have to come.

319
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,230
{\fs16\an2\b0}不错  我可以留在那儿看着沃尔维茨勾引佩妮
Right,I could have stayed behind and watch wolowitz try to hit on penny
